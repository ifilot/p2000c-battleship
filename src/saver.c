/* saver.c -- CRT screen saver.
 *
 * Idle time is taken from the BIOS 60 Hz tick counter when clock_probe()
 * found one; otherwise it is estimated by counting keyboard polls, with
 * POLLS_PER_SECOND calibrated in the emulator for a bare polling loop (an
 * idle hook that does work per poll slows that estimate down, which is why
 * the tick counter is preferred).
 *
 * The saver itself lives in the 80x24 text mode with the cursor hidden, and
 * prints its caption with the quarter-bright attribute, so hardly any
 * phosphor is driven and never at one place for long.
 *
 * Every key the program takes goes through here, which also filters out
 * doubled keys. While the board is being drawn the terminal board is busy
 * with picture data, and a key pressed meanwhile can arrive twice (its
 * release seen late, the keyboard's auto-repeat fires). So when a key kept
 * the program busy for BUSY_TICKS or more (a shot and the reply, a whole
 * screen), the same key again is dropped if it was already waiting when
 * the program became ready for the next key, or comes within ECHO_TICKS
 * after that: sooner than anyone reacts to the new picture. Quick keys (a
 * cursor step) are never filtered, so a key tapped or held repeats as
 * usual. Without the BIOS clock every waiting copy of the previous key is
 * dropped, and one within ECHO_POLLS polls.
